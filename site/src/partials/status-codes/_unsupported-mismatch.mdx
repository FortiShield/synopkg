One or more of the instances of this dependency features a version specifier which synopkg does not support. As such, synopkg can't know what to do and this will need to be manually resolved.

This can also occur if the name of the package is not supported. A common case of this is [pnpm overrides](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides).
